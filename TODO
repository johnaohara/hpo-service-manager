 - Detect if a job is run in the middle of an experiment we need to ignore jobs that are not an expriment trial
 - Complex mapping of config items to jenkins input params
 - Experiment state machine -
 - retry logic
 - lab state validation
 - Distinguish between trial and recommendation
 - downstream triggers based on recommendation (i.e. filters for recommendations and change detection based on recommendation)

 DONE - run in qDup (instead of jenkins)- another backend for running experiments
 - Fix constant re-render
 - refactor GUI to be more logical
 - use fetchival to fetch data
 - CSV output from Horreum - all data from experiment
 - Upload experiment ID as a label for horreum fingerprint
 - horreum upload in javascript
 - Top X configurations
 - Create admin modal form
 - Abstract runtime environments, need to
    - register yaml parser
    - load via service registry
    - pick up from class path
    - dynamically determine which runtime to pick

  Find qDup example where I handle system.exit() calls and redirect logging
